RFID Door Locker / Unlocker
By: Nicholas McGill
----------------------------------
This code was created specifically for using an Arduino microcontroller with a Seeedstudio 125 kHz RFID reader.  The idea is to be able to tag into any room by using the deadbolt as the lock and a powerful servo motor -- or any other motor with enough torque -- to turn your deadbolt.
